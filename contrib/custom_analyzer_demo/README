## Introduction
This is a demo to show how to implement an custom analyzer for openGauss.
This demo changes the logic of check_ungrouped_columns_walker, in order to support syntax like SELECT a, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a; which is not supported by original openGauss.
The main logic is to implement an custom AnalyzerRoutine. Check function transformStmt for more details.

## Installation
Copy custom_analyzer_demo directoty to openGauss-server/contrib and make.
```
cp contrib/custom_analyzer_demo /YOUR_PATH/openGauss-server/contrib -r
cd /YOUR_PATH/openGauss-server/contrib
make && make install
```

## Use extension
Connect to gaussdb and create extension.
```
CREATE EXTENSION custom_analyzer_demo;
```

## Test the extension
```
CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b int);
INSERT INTO t1 values(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,66),(2,88);
SELECT a, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a; --- report error

SET custom_analyzer_demo.enable_custom_analyzer to true;
SELECT a, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a; --- success
```
