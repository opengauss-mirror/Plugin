This is a demo to show how to implement an custom analyzer for openGauss.
This demo changes the logic of check_ungrouped_columns_walker, in order to support syntax like SELECT a, b FROM t1 GROUP BY a; which is not supported by original openGauss.
The main logic is to implement an custom AnalyzerRoutine. Check function transformStmt for more details.
